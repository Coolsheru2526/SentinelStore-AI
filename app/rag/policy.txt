15. INVENTORY AVAILABILITY, STOCK DEPLETION & SHELF REFILL MANAGEMENT
15.1 Scope

This section governs how stock depletion, empty shelves, and inventory unavailability are:

• Detected
• Classified
• Escalated
• Communicated
• Resolved

using AI vision, audio, POS signals, and human confirmation.

15.2 Stock Depletion Detection Sources

Stock availability issues may be detected through one or more of the following:

Vision-Based Signals
• Empty shelf detection via CCTV
• Partial shelf depletion patterns
• Repeated customer interaction with empty shelf space
• Misplaced or fallen items indicating restocking failure

Audio-Based Signals
• Customer or staff verbal reports such as:

“This item is out of stock”

“Shelf is empty”

“Do you have more of this?”
• Repeated similar queries within a short time window

System-Based Signals
• POS inventory mismatch
• Sudden drop to zero stock levels
• Reorder threshold breach
• Supplier delivery delay notifications

All detections must be linked to a unique Incident ID.

15.3 Stock Depletion Severity Classification
Scenario	Severity Level
Single low-demand item unavailable	Level 1
High-demand item unavailable	Level 2
Essential daily-use item unavailable	Level 3
Safety-critical item unavailable (medicine, water, fire equipment)	Level 4
Regulatory or contractual violation due to stock unavailability	Level 5
15.4 Vision-Based Shelf Analysis Rules

AI vision systems may classify shelves as depleted if:

• >70% of shelf space is empty
• Identified product slots contain no detectable items
• Repeated detection across ≥ 3 frames within 60 seconds

AI must not assume theft unless corroborated by other signals.

15.5 Audio-Based Stock Identification Rules

Audio detections are valid when:

• Stock-related keywords are detected
• Confidence ≥ 0.70
• Same item mentioned ≥ 2 times within 5 minutes

Audio-only detection cannot escalate above Severity 3 without visual or system confirmation.

15.6 AI Response Rules for Stock Depletion
Allowed Autonomous Actions (Confidence ≥ 0.75)

• Notify store staff or floor associate
• Trigger internal restocking alert
• Update digital shelf labels or kiosks
• Log inventory anomaly for audit

Human Approval Required

• Supplier escalation
• Customer compensation offers
• Store-wide announcements
• Emergency substitutions

15.7 Shelf Refill & Recovery SLA
Severity	Expected Response Time
Level 1	Next scheduled restock
Level 2	Within 60 minutes
Level 3	Within 30 minutes
Level 4	Immediate action required
Level 5	Escalate to management and compliance teams

Failure to meet SLA triggers automatic escalation.

15.8 Customer Communication Standards (Stock Issues)

• Apologetic and neutral tone
• No blame attribution
• Offer alternatives when available
• Provide estimated restock time if known

Example:

“We’re sorry, this item is currently unavailable. A team member has been notified to assist you.”

15.9 AI Confidence & Governance Rules
Confidence Score	Action
≥ 0.80	Autonomous handling allowed
0.60–0.79	Human confirmation recommended
< 0.60	Human validation mandatory

All decisions must log:
• Detection source (vision/audio/system)
• Item identifier (SKU if available)
• Shelf location
• Timestamp
• Confidence score

15.10 Post-Incident Review

Stock incidents classified as Severity ≥ 3 require:

• Root cause analysis
• Supplier performance review
• Restocking workflow audit

Repeat occurrences trigger policy enforcement review.

15.11 Policy Enforcement

Failure to respond to verified stock depletion incidents may result in:

• Operational penalties
• SLA breach reporting
• AI autonomy restriction
• Staff accountability measures

15.12 Policy Integration

This section integrates with:

• Incident Severity Classification (Section 3)
• AI Confidence Governance (Section 8)
• Human-in-the-Loop Requirements (Section 9)
• Post-Incident Review (Section 11)
